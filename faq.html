<p>
Sure you can! How can we be true champions of diversity if we didn’t allow that? However, we are a jobs platform that champions women and marginalized genders so you may find that our content and coaching speaks to the challenges we face specifically as women. Most, if not all of the jobs listed on our platform will no doubt be listed in many other places by employers, so you won’t miss the opportunity to apply. We aren’t about taking anything away from men, we are about creating an equal playing field for women.
